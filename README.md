# online_fighter
Fighter game hosted on react using firebase for online multiplayer and leaderboard (WIP). The "React_game" folder contains the online side of the game including the firebase backend framework. The "2d_fighter_local" folder has a local multiplayer version of a 2D fighter game.

The current plan is to create Sprite models for two players and give them basic attack animations in the local file, and then host this on a react webpage to create an online version of the game that has a leaderboard of wins. Using firebase for this allows us to have authentication capabilities to store the data for this.
